## Installation

To install Tagify, download the latest installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/TagifyProject/Releases/releases).

Then, go through the wizard like you would with any other software.

## Goals

- Organize files in a more efficient way
- Make it easier to find files
- Save time by automating the organization process

## Inspiration

Tagify has heavily been inspired by the following projects, but they didn't really fit my needs.
I needed something QUICK. Something that could run for some time, then automatically tag all my files.

- TagStudio
- Google Photos
- PhotoPrism
